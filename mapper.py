class Mapper(object):
    '''
    Code reused from Edward Minnett (ed@methodic.io).
    The Mapper is responsible for maintaining a map of what is known about
    the maze. This is achieved by storing and upding two sets of two-dimensional
    lists. One stores knowledge about the walls and openings in the maze
    along with where in the maze the state of a wall or opening is unknown.
    The other two-dimensional list stores information about how many possible
    shapes each cell could have given the current knowledge of the maze walls.
    This second two-dimensional list, in effect, represents the uncertainty
    within the current maze map.

        NB: The nature of storing both horizontal and vertical walls in the same

        a given maze_dim, there will be 2 * maze_dim + 1 sets of walls: the
        vertical left exterior walls, maze_dim sets of horizontal walls
        (interior and exterior), maze_dim - 1 sets of interior vertical walls,
        and the right vertical extreior walls. This also results in the
        following additional quirk: lists representing vertical walls will
        have length maze_dim while lists representing horizontal walls will
        have length maze_dim + 1 (because of the exterior walls top and bottom).
